# MAVISS Description Package

## Overview

The `maviss_description` package contains the URDF and related files for defining the MAVISS drone's kinematics, visual model, and collision properties. This package is essential for visualization, simulation, and integration with ROS 2-based applications.

## Features

- URDF Model: Defines the MAVISS drone's structure.
- Xacro Support: Enables modular and reusable URDF definitions.
- Mesh Files: 3D models for visualization in RViz and Gazebo.
- Collision and Inertia Properties: Optimized for physics-based simulations.

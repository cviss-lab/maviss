FCU Setup
=========

This section covers the setup of the **Flight Control Unit (FCU)**, based on the 
Pixhawk autopilot running PX4 firmware. The FCU provides low-level flight 
stabilization, GPS integration, and communication with the companion computer.

At a high level, this includes:

- **Firmware flashing** – installing PX4 on the Pixhawk.  
- **Sensor calibration** – configuring compass, accelerometer, and GPS using 
  QGroundControl.  
- **Parameter setup** – adjusting PX4 parameters for stable flight and 
  integration with companion systems.  
- **MAVLink connection** – establishing communication between Pixhawk, 
  companion computer, and ground control station.

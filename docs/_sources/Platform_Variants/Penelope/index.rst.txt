Penelope
==========

The **Penelope** variant of MAVISS is designed for **enhanced 3D perception and mapping** using the **Livox Mid-360 LiDAR**.  
Compared to the barebone and AC1-based Evander platform, Penelope focuses on **high-resolution environment modeling** to support advanced navigation, obstacle avoidance, and SLAM research.

Key Characteristics:

- Equipped with **Livox Mid-360**, a compact 360Â° LiDAR optimized for UAVs.  
- Provides **dense point cloud data** suitable for real-time mapping.  
- Supports integration with **Jetson Orin NX** for onboard SLAM and perception pipelines.  
- Designed for **indoor/outdoor autonomous missions**, where accurate obstacle detection is critical.  

The hardware and software documentation for Penelope goes into detail about the **sensor mounting, wiring, ROS 2 drivers, and integration workflows** needed to unlock the full potential of the Livox Mid-360 in aerial robotics.

Evander
========

The **Evander** variant extends the barebone MAVISS platform by integrating the
**RoboSense AC1**. This configuration enables advanced perception
capabilities for mapping and environment understanding, while still maintaining
a relatively lightweight setup.

It is best suited for:

- **3D environment mapping** – generating dense point clouds of the flight area.  
- **Perception-enhanced navigation** – providing situational awareness for semi-autonomous or supervised missions. 
- **Visual Interial Odometry (VIO)** – Providing External Vision for indoor stable flight without relying on the GPS.  
- **Research experiments** – testing LiDAR-based SLAM, obstacle avoidance, and perception-driven autonomy modules.

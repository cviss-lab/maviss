Platform Variants
=================

MAVISS is designed as a **modular platform**, so it can be tailored for
different levels of perception and autonomy depending on mission needs.

- **Barebone** – GPS-only configuration for manual or waypoint-based flight.  
- **Evander** – Adds the **AC1 perception stack** for real-time mapping,
  obstacle detection, and enhanced navigation.  
- **Penelope** – Equipped with the **Livox LiDAR stack** for high-resolution
  3D sensing, enabling more accurate SLAM and autonomous navigation.
